## Installation
Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrismuntean/Handify.git
```
<br>

### Configure environment variables
Format for `.env` file
```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_SPORTIFY_CLIENT>
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_SPOTIFY_SECRET>

FLASK_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_GENERATED_SECRET_KEY>
FLASK_HOST=http://0.0.0.0:8080
FLASK_DEBUG=True
```
**TIPS:**
* Sign up as a developer with Spotify to get a client ID and secret at [developer.spotify.com](https://developer.spotify.com)
* Generate a secure flask secret key by running: `$ python -c "import secrets; print(secrets token_hex(32))"`
* Flask host for running with Python virtual environment is http://127.0.0.1:5000 for Docker it is http://0.0.0.0:8080
* `FLASK_DEBUG` also determines to use secure/ insecure cookies (use True for local development)
